Jambo! and welcome! akiligrid is a grid bot that uses the grid strategy to trade crypto currencies. The word **akili** means brain or mind in Swahili. The objective here is to make it the most intelligent grid bot in existence that has as many advanced features as possible, but which at the same time can be used by your typical crypto trader with basic grid bot experience

This, as with all projects was born out of frustration on the lack of features with "commercial" bots out there. They always missed that little tweak that in my mind would make things a lot more better, and hopefully profitable.

Let's get the usual out of the way...
